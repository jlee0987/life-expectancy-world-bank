# 🌎 Life Expectancy Analysis
#### Description
The objective of this project is to determine if various socio-economic factors (such as income levels, CO2 emissions, health expenditure, etc.) are a useful indicator or predictor of life expectancy. <br/>


#### Background
▪ The dataset I have chosen is a World Bank CSV Dataset which covers a period of 20 years – from 2000 to 2019.<br/>
▪ I have filtered the data for 2019 to present a more current analysis.<br/>

#### Dataset
The Kaggle dataset used for this analysis can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life- expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank/data
