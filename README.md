# ðŸŒŽ Life Expectancy Analysis
#### Description
The objective of this project is to determine if various socio-economic factors (such as income levels, CO2 emissions, health expenditure, etc.) are a useful indicator or predictor of life expectancy. The Python libraries used include: pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. <br/>


#### Background
â–ª&ensp;The dataset I have chosen is a World Bank CSV Dataset which covers a period of 20 years â€“ from 2000 to 2019.<br/>
â–ª&ensp;I have filtered the data for 2019 to present a more current analysis.<br/>

#### Dataset
The Kaggle dataset used for this analysis can be found here:<br/> [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank/discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank/data)
