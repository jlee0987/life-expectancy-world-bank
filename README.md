# ðŸŒŽ Life Expectancy Analysis
### Description
The objective of this project is to determine if various socio-economic factors (such as income levels, CO2 emissions, health expenditure, etc.) are a useful indicator or predictor of life expectancy. <br/>


### Background
â–ª The dataset I have chosen is a World Bank CSV Dataset which covers a period of 20 years â€“ from 2000 to 2019.<br/>
â–ª I have filtered the data for 2019 to present a more current analysis.<br/>
